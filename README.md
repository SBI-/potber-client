## How to use

Visit https://www.potber.de (or https://test.potber.de for the staging environment) to use the app.

## Core features

### Browser support

Potber supports the following browsers. Other browser might work, but are not supported. The app might still behave and display differently on different devices.

- Chrome >= 108
- Chrome for Android >= 108
- Firefox >= 107
- Firefox for Android >= 107
- Safari on iOS >= 16.1

### Standalone mode (PWA)

The app supports standalone mode ([PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)). In stadalone mode, the website behaves almost exactly like an App. Whether your browser supports standalone mode and how to enable it highly depends on your browser. Android Chrome offers an option to "Install app" in your website settings, while iOS Safari has an option to "Add website to home screen". If you're having trouble, maybe [this article](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/installation/) can be of help.

### BBCode parser

The application includes a functioning and fully custom BBCode parser written in TypeScript. It is able to parse most of the board's BBCode without errors and is being continously worked on. You can find it [here](app/services//content-parser.ts).

### Theme support

You can customize the application's appearance via the available themes. Additionally, feel free to create your own theme and suggest adding it to the app. The individual steps might depend on your browser, but this is rougly how you do it:

1. Open the application on a desktop device. Make sure you have the 'default' theme selected as it'll make the process easier.
2. Rightclick anywhere into the application and hit `Inspect` (or `Untersuchen` in german). What you see now is the inspector panel. In the panel, look for the `styles` container. It looks rougly like this:

```css
element {
  ...
}

:root {
  ...
}
...
```

3. Scroll down in that container until you see a section called `html, html *`
4. You can now change any of the default theme's variables.
5. Send me a copy of the entire section and tell me how the theme should be called. ðŸ™‚

If you feel skilled enough, you can also create a PR of course. Themes are located [here](app/styles/themes/). All themes will be merged with the default theme, so you only need to provide variables you want to override.

## How to develop or build the app

### Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with npm)
- [Ember CLI](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/)
- [potber-api](ttps://github.com/spuxx1701/potber-api) - Without this web server, potber-client does not function.

### Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/spuxx1701/potber-client.git`
- `cd potber-client`
- `npm install`

### Running / Development

- Clone [potber-api](https://github.com/spuxx1701/potber-api) and start up a local instance.
- Start up the development server with `npm start`.
- Visit the app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

#### Linting

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run lint:fix`

#### Testing

- `npm run test`
- `npm run test:coverage`

#### Building

- `ember build` (development)
- `ember build --environment staging` (staging)
- `ember build --environment production` (production)

#### Deploying

The application can be deployed via [Docker](https://docker.com). The application provides two different Dockerfiles for the staging and production environments:

- [staging](Dockerfile.staging)
- [production](Dockerfile.production)

After building the Docker image, you can run it locally or on a remote host. In case you're curious about how `potber.de` is hosted: Both the [test](https://test.potber.de) and [production](https://potber.de) environments run on a [Flux](https://fluxcd.io)-controlled [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) cluster. The infrastructure is documented [here](https://github.com/spuxx1701/flux/tree/master/cluster/apps/potber).
